## üí´ Motivation

I wanted a CLI that could live reload the browser page as well as live restart the server. I tried to find such a tool, but didn't find one. So I made stella - that could reload backend as well as frontend code. Also the builtin debug modes for web frameworks sucked.

<br>

## ‚öôÔ∏è How does stella work?

stella continuously watches for file changes in the project, while respecting the gitignore file and whenever a change is made, it kills the existing process and spawns a new process using subprocess. What about browser reload? It uses selenium to accomplish that.

<br>


## üí° Usage

This section briefly describes how to use the stella CLI.

### init

```
stella init
```

The `init` command writes a default `stella.yml` config file in the working directory. The default configuration looks like this:

```yml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shravan-1908/stellapy/master/schema.json 
browser: firefox
include_only: []
poll_interval: 500
browser_wait_interval: 1000
follow_symlinks: false
scripts:
- name: default
  url: ''
  command: echo 'hello'
  shell: true
```

This yaml file comes with a schema

<!-- todo describe config file, how stella finds it -->
<!-- todo stella.ignore file -->


### run

```
stella run SCRIPT_NAME
```

The `run` command is used to start stella.
It expects one optional argument: the script name to run from the config file.


While stella is running, you can input `rs` to restart the server and refresh the browser page manually, and `rb` only to refresh the browser page.

To stop stella, input `ex`. It will close the browser as well as kill the running process gracefully.

- y is the MINOR version and is incremented when a backwards compatible change to stella is made, like changing dependencies or adding a new function, method, or features.
- z is the PATCH version and is incremented after making minor changes that don't affect stella's public API or dependencies, like fixing a bug.
